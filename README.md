Run the notebook to replicate the experiments.
The results are stored in excel-files, see folders experiment1 and experiment2. Those are merged with the python code in those folders.

The visualization is then created with the tableau file.
You can access the dashboards online here:
  experiment1 - performance:
  experiment1 - runtime:
  experiment2 - performance:
